        <h3>About me...</h3>
        Hi there! I am Sudeep and this is my personal page. As you might have guessed from the title, I am a bioinformatician. This 
        page is to tell a little bit about myself, what I is expertise/what I am working on and what are my interests and goals. <br><br>
        Most of my work has been on Next Generation Sequencing data: primarily on RNA-seq data. I have also been woking on ChIP-seq datasets,
        Ribo-seq datasets and a couple of custom "flavors" of sequencing data. In the past I have worked on CRISPR-Cas9 prediction pipeline and 
        have been looking into integrative data analysis: combining data generated from biological experiments along with data and annotations from biological databases.

        <h3>So is that it?</h3>
        Well not quite... besides bioinformatics, I am also interested in data science and the whole flurry of fields associated with it. I have some experience in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jas/article-abstract/90/10/3666/4717907" target="_blank">text mining
        and Named Entity recognition</a> and I am interested in machine learning, data representation and visualization. I occassionaly post some of my work in <a href="https://github.com/sudeepsahadevan" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and sometimes write up machine learning 
        related kernels in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ssudeep" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>.
        
        <h3>Where do I work?</h3>
        I work as a bioinformatics engineer/data analyst in Hentze group at EMBL Heidelberg, and I am in this position since January 2019. Here are the links to <a href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/directors_research/hentze/index.html" target="_blank">Hentze group 
        home page</a> and my EMBL <a href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/directors_research/hentze/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60019915" target="_blank">personal page</a> if you are interested.
